# smallpop's wish.com GNU nano 

A small terminal text editor. 
Built mostly to get experience writing C and to learn how to use CMake, most of this code was inspired or taken [from here](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/):  
Currently only allows text input and saving. The goal is to build it into something that has a similar amount of editing features as GNU nano.

Use CMake to build an executable.
